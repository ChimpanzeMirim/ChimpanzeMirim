## 👋 Welcome to my profile!

Hey there! My name is João, and I'm currently studying **Computer Science**.

### 💼 Work Experience
- Currently working with **IT infrastructure**  
- Also doing some **freelance work** in hardware repair

### 🚀 What I'm Looking For
I'm interested in **open-source** projects, mainly to learn more about **Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python**, and other technologies.  
To be honest, I'm still discovering what I enjoy most and which language I’ll focus on in the future.

### 👨‍💻 More About Me
- I'm a new member of the **developer community**, so I don’t have many projects or deep knowledge in any language yet — but I’m learning and improving every day.  
- I'm also a member of the **LGBTQIA+ community**, and my pronouns are **he/him**.  
- My hobbies include playing puzzle games, drawing, practicing upcycling, and sometimes just going outside to explore the city.
